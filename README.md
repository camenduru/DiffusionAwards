### 👀 Voters
- More than 100 voters will be invited to join the voting session. 
- We will invite those who have made significant contributions to the community, including artists and developers.
- We will announce the usernames of those who have been invited to join on June 1st, 2023.

### ❤ Voting Process
- Using the prompts provided by the applicants, we will generate images, which will then be shown to the voters.
- All PNG info will be deleted from the images, so voters will not know which images belong to which creator.
- The voters will indicate their preference for each image by ❤ liking the image on https://twitter.com/DiffusionAwards.
- All ❤ votes (likes) will be made public and shown in real-time on https://twitter.com/DiffusionAwards.
- This is an example voting system demonstration.
- Even if an image receives 10,000 ❤ likes, only the ❤ likes from voters will be counted as a vote.

- In the event of two models having equal like counts, the model that was made public first will win.

### 💰 Money Award
- The award winners will be announced on July 1st, 2023.
- Since the ko-fi.com donations are public, we will collect the money using https://ko-fi.com/DiffusionAwards and distribute the funds to the award winners also using ko-fi.com
- All the money collected until July 1st, 2023, will be shared as follows: First, we will divide the total funds into two. One piece will go to the Best Anime Trained Model, and the other piece will go to the Best Realistic Trained Model. The other half will be divided into 12 and shared evenly among the other categories.
- For example, if we collect $24 USD dollars, the Best Anime Trained Model winner will receive $6 USD dollars, the Best Realistic Trained Model winner will receive $6 USD dollars, and the winners of the other categories will receive $1 USD dollar each. Categories added by sponsors not included.
- On July 1st, 2023, the collection of donations on ko-fi.com will stop.

### 🖨 Sponsors (Companies)
- We will invite sponsors (companies) to contribute to the prize pool and provide additional prizes to the award winners. 
- If we continue with the example above, any winner would receive a money award plus any additional prize provided by sponsors.
- Sponsors (companies) should give the sponsor-provided prize directly to the winners.
- If we obtain any sponsors (companies), we will announce what they are providing to the award winners on this page.
- If sponsors wish, they can add their own category. For example, an architecture firm that wants to become a sponsor can add the 'Best Architectural Trained Model' category and provide special awards for the created category.

### 🍡 Type of sponsorship
